# Steganography

A fun project to try and encode a text file into an image using Python's Pillow module.

The text file used was the Bible and the image used was an image of the Bible.

The requirement for size is if the text file is converted to a binary string (BString) then the image must have BString/2 bytes as the last two bits of each byte are where the text is hidden.

Encryption version hopefully coming soon.
